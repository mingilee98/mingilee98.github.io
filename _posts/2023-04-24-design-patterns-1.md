## Learning Design Patterns

We will learn about design patterns that allow us to accelerate the development process and promote software reuse. 

The book that we will use is *"Head First Design Patterns"*.


## Why do we need them?

**someone has already solved our problems.**

If we can load our brains with the design patterns and apply them, we can make maintainable and reusable code.
